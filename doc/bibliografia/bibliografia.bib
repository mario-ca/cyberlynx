ABSTRACT = {Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have been widely deployed as a powerful tool to prevent, detect, and react against cyber-attacks. SIEM solutions have evolved to become comprehensive systems that provide a wide visibility to identify areas of high risks and proactively focus on mitigation strategies aiming at reducing costs and time for incident response. Currently, SIEM systems and related solutions are slowly converging with big data analytics tools. We survey the most widely used SIEMs regarding their critical functionality and provide an analysis of external factors affecting the SIEM landscape in mid and long-term. A list of potential enhancements for the next generation of SIEMs is provided as part of the review of existing solutions as well as an analysis on their benefits and usage in critical infrastructures.},

In density-based clustering, a cluster is a set of data objects spread in the data space over a contiguous region of high density of objects. Density-based clusters are separated from each other by contiguous regions of low density of objects.

abstract="Silhouette index is commonly used in cluster analysis for finding the optimal number of clusters, as well as for final clustering validation and evaluation as a synthetic indicator allowing to measure the general quality of clustering (relative compactness and separability of clusters---see Walesiak and Gatnar in Statystyczna analiza danych z wykorzystaniem programu R. PWN, Warszawa, p. 420, 2009). Its advantage is low computational complexity and simple interpretation rules. Recently, some proposals have appeared to use this index directly as basis of clustering algorithms. The paper is a tryout of the evaluation of such approach. In the paper examples, when the ``mechanical'' use of the silhouette index leads to the results that do not correspond to the actual structure of the classes are shown, the recommendations on the principles of the correct application of the index are presented.",

journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
abstract = {Clustering is a data mining technique used to analyse data that has variations and the number of lots. Clustering was process of grouping data into a cluster, so they contained data that is as similar as possible and different from other cluster objects. SMEs Indonesia has a variety of customers, but SMEs do not have the mapping of these customers so they did not know which customers are loyal or otherwise. Customer mapping is a grouping of customer profiling to facilitate analysis and policy of SMEs in the production of goods, especially batik sales. Researchers will use a combination of K-Means method with elbow to improve efficient and effective k-means performance in processing large amounts of data. K-Means Clustering is a localized optimization method that is sensitive to the selection of the starting position from the midpoint of the cluster. So choosing the starting position from the midpoint of a bad cluster will result in K-Means Clustering algorithm resulting in high errors and poor cluster results. The K-means algorithm has problems in determining the best number of clusters. So Elbow looks for the best number of clusters on the K-means method. Based on the results obtained from the process in determining the best number of clusters with elbow method can produce the same number of clusters K on the amount of different data. The result of determining the best number of clusters with elbow method will be the default for characteristic process based on case study. Measurement of k-means value of k-means has resulted in the best clusters based on SSE values on 500 clusters of batik visitors. The result shows the cluster has a sharp decrease is at K = 3, so K as the cut-off point as the best cluster.}

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

abstract = {Virtualization is used in data center and cloud environments to decouple applications from the hardware they run on. Hardware virtualization and operating system level virtualization are two prominent technologies that enable this. Containers, which use OS virtualization, have recently surged in interest and deployment. In this paper, we study the differences between the two virtualization technologies. We compare containers and virtual machines in large data center environments along the dimensions of performance, manageability and software development.We evaluate the performance differences caused by the different virtualization technologies in data center environments where multiple applications are running on the same servers (multi-tenancy). Our results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads. We also evaluate differences in the management frameworks which control deployment and orchestration of containers and VMs. We show how the different capabilities exposed by the two virtualization technologies can affect the management and development of applications. Lastly, we evaluate novel approaches which combine hardware and OS virtualization.},

abstract = {A novel probabilistic retrieval model is presented. It forms a basis to interpret the TF-IDF term weights as making relevance decisions. It simulates the local relevance decision-making for every location of a document, and combines all of these “local” relevance decisions as the “document-wide” relevance decision for the document. The significance of interpreting TF-IDF in this way is the potential to: (1) establish a unifying perspective about information retrieval as relevance decision-making; and (2) develop advanced TF-IDF-related term weights for future elaborate retrieval models. Our novel retrieval model is simplified to a basic ranking formula that directly corresponds to the TF-IDF term weights. In general, we show that the term-frequency factor of the ranking formula can be rendered into different term-frequency factors of existing retrieval systems. In the basic ranking formula, the remaining quantity - log p(r¯|t ∈ d) is interpreted as the probability of randomly picking a nonrelevant usage (denoted by r¯) of term t. Mathematically, we show that this quantity can be approximated by the inverse document-frequency (IDF). Empirically, we show that this quantity is related to IDF, using four reference TREC ad hoc retrieval data collections.},

abstract = {The cyber security industry is rapidly adopting threat hunting as a proactive tool for early and faster detection of suspected malicious actors. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method, Unsupervised Hunting of Anomalous Commands (UHAC), to detect text-based anomalous commands in security information and event management (SIEM) logs that are good candidates for threat hunting. A unique feature of the proposed method is that it first creates a feature set based on the augmentation of document-term and document-character matrices. Then, an autoencoder-based detector is trained on this feature set using a custom loss function. UHAC consistently outperforms other feature sets and algorithms such as one-class support vector machine, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and word-embedding based models such as word2vec. The UHAC detector identifies 84–89% of anomalies in the top 10% of the data. Findings have implications for cybersecurity analysts who perform threat hunting in SIEM logs for process auditing on endpoint devices.}

abstract = {In the face of increasing global disruptions, the cybersecurity field is confronting rising threats posed by offensive groups and individual hackers. Traditional security measures often fall short in detecting and mitigating these sophisticated attacks, necessitating advanced intrusion detection methods. The goal of our study is to develop robust network intrusion detection methods using machine learning techniques. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in detecting network intrusions. Model performances are optimized through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. A range of classification and clustering models have been employed. Data from SIEM systems capturing real-time statistics from cloud-hosted Windows virtual machines has been gathered and augmented with web attack logs from CICIDS2017, each comprising approximately fifteen thousand rows. Hyperparameter tuning, data normalization, standardization and feature selection techniques for model optimization have been used in our study. The research showcases the potential of machine learning in enhancing network intrusion detection capabilities. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the Random Forest Classifier (0.97) and highlight the importance of utilizing diverse datasets and advanced optimization techniques. This study offers valuable insights and sets a foundation for future advancements in cybersecurity strategies and intrusion detection systems.}

User and Entity behavior analytics is a powerful tool to prevent various threats. Through this paper, we bring to you a proposed machine learning UEBA model which protects user data and prevents insider threats more efficiently. We have tried to compare four different unsupervised algorithms which we believe to be far superior to the normally supervised machine learning algorithms. Our main aim is to provide a more efficient UEBA model through the combination of the above-mentioned algorithms. On comparing with the normally used supervised algorithms, we have observed that our proposed model works much more efficiently and is less time-consuming.},
